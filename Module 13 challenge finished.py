# Prediction: Which model will perform better?
# I expect the Random Forest Classifier to perform better than Logistic Regression. 
# Random Forests are more adept at capturing complex, non-linear relationships, 
# which are often present in spam detection datasets. 
# This prediction will be compared with the evaluation results later to ensure alignment.

# Note: A value of 0 in the "spam" column means that the message is legitimate.
#       A value of 1 means that the message has been classified as spam.
